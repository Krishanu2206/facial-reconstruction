## 10-Day Plan with Checkpoints

### Day 1-2: Project Setup and Data Preparation
#### Checkpoint 1: Project structure and data ready
- [ ] Set up project folder structure
- [ ] Gather dataset of low-quality CCTV footage and high-quality facial images
- [ ] Implement basic data preprocessing pipeline
- [ ] Create a data loader for efficient batch processing

**Tasks to achieve this checkpoint:**
1. Use the provided folder structure to set up your project
2. Collect or create a dataset of at least 1000 image pairs (low-quality CCTV and high-quality faces)
3. Write scripts in `src/data/` for data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation
4. Implement a PyTorch or TensorFlow data loader in `src/data/make_dataset.py`

### Day 3-4: Model Architecture and Basic Implementation
#### Checkpoint 2: Basic model architecture implemented
- [ ] Research and choose appropriate ML techniques
- [ ] Implement basic facial reconstruction model
- [ ] Set up training pipeline

**Tasks to achieve this checkpoint:**
1. Review recent papers on facial reconstruction and image enhancement
2. Implement a basic model (e.g., U-Net or GAN) in `src/models/train_model.py`
3. Set up a training loop with appropriate loss functions
4. Implement basic logging and model checkpointing

### Day 5-6: Image Enhancement and Model Refinement
#### Checkpoint 3: Enhanced model with image processing techniques
- [ ] Implement additional image enhancement techniques
- [ ] Integrate enhancements into the model pipeline
- [ ] Refine model based on initial results

**Tasks to achieve this checkpoint:**
1. Implement super-resolution, noise reduction, and deblurring in `src/features/build_features.py`
2. Modify your model architecture to incorporate these enhancements
3. Retrain the model and compare results with the basic version
4. Implement evaluation metrics in `src/models/evaluate_model.py`

### Day 7-8: Optimization and Real-time Processing
#### Checkpoint 4: Optimized model for real-time processing
- [ ] Profile model performance
- [ ] Implement optimization techniques
- [ ] Develop real-time processing pipeline

**Tasks to achieve this checkpoint:**
1. Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks
2. Apply optimization techniques like model pruning or quantization
3. Implement a real-time processing pipeline in `pipelines/inference_pipeline.py`
4. Benchmark the optimized model for speed and accuracy

### Day 9: Documentation and Technical Paper
#### Checkpoint 5: Completed technical paper and documentation
- [ ] Write technical paper
- [ ] Document code and create README
- [ ] Prepare visualizations and comparisons

**Tasks to achieve this checkpoint:**
1. Write the technical paper in `reports/technical_paper.md`, explaining your approach, challenges, and results
2. Add docstrings and comments to all major functions and classes
3. Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide
4. Generate before/after visualizations using `src/visualization/visualize.py`

### Day 10: Final Testing and Submission Preparation
#### Checkpoint 6: Submission ready
- [ ] Conduct final testing
- [ ] Prepare submission package
- [ ] Plan future enhancements

**Tasks to achieve this checkpoint:**
1. Run comprehensive tests on various CCTV footage samples
2. Organize all required submission components (POC, paper, code)
3. Outline potential improvements for the next round (e.g., 3D reconstruction, facial recognition integration)
4. Review submission guidelines and ensure all requirements are met
